# Apple Picker Game
## Course Information
Southern Illinois University Edwardsville

## Project Overview
Apple Picker is a 2D arcade-style game where the player controls a basket to catch falling apples while avoiding dangerous falling branches. The difficulty increases by rounds, and the game ends if the player catches a branch or misses too many apples.

The game demonstrates foundational Unity concepts including:

 - Scene management
 - UI integration
 - Collision handling
 - Prefabs and spawning systems
 - Game state control
 - Multi-round gameplay progression

### Game Aspect Notes
When loaded into Unity, the Aspect Ratio will default to "Free Aspect". This may cut off the top portion of the text, so for best results change the aspect ratio to either 16:9 or Full HD (1920 x 1080)

## Gameplay
### How to Play
 - Move basket left/right using mouse
